ACS_OER_00006_5.txt,"The nickel foam was ultrasonicated in acetone, 10% HCl aqueous solution, and DI water successively and then vacuum-dried at 60 °C. A previous method of preparation of Fe-doped nickel sulfide (FeNi2S4)  was suitably modified to support dual borate/Fe doping and catalyst deposition on a nickel foam. Briefly, 1.5 mmol FeSO4 7H2O, 2 mmol NiSO4·6H2O, 1.5 mmol K2B4O7·4H2O, and 8 mmol l-cysteine were dissolved in 40 mL of a glycol–DI water mixture (1:1 v/v) and rigorously stirred for 30 min. This mixture and a pretreated nickel foam (3 cm × 2 cm) were transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 8 h. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the nickel foam was removed, washed with water several times, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum. For comparative studies, Fe-free borate-doped Ni3S2 was also prepared by the same procedure sans the use of iron sulfate. Likewise, borate/Fe-free undoped Ni3S2 was also prepared without Fe and borate precursors. The catalyst loading on NF was in the range of 4–6 mg cm–2.","{'SUBSTRATE': 'nickel foam'}, {'PRECURSOR': 'FeSO4 7H2O'}, {'PRECURSOR': 'NiSO4·6H2O'}, {'ADDITIVE': 'K2B4O7·4H2O'}, {'SOLVENT': 'glycol–DI water'}, {'ADDITIVE': 'l-cysteine'}, {'TARGET': 'Fe-doped nickel sulfide (FeNi2S4)'}"
Elsevier_OER_02380_10.txt,"All the chemicals used in this experiment were analytical grade with the high purity (99.99 %). Hydrothermal approach was used to prepare the nanosheet-shaped ZIF-67 nanomaterials. In a general procedure, 1 g of Co (NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 60 ml of a mixed solution of distilled (DI) water, ethanol, and N,N-dimethylformamide, where was added 0.5 g of 2-Methylimidazole. After stirring for 1 h, the reaction mixture was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and it was kept at 160 °C for 12 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, purple precipitate was collected and washed multiple times with copious amounts of water and ethanol to eliminate any organic residuals. Finally, the filtered powder was dried overnight at 80 °C prior to further analysis.","{'TARGET': 'ZIF-67'}, {'PRECURSOR': 'Co (NO3)2·6H2O'}, {'SOLVENT': 'distilled (DI) water'}, {'SOLVENT': 'ethanol'}, {'SOLVENT': 'N,N-dimethylformamide'}, {'ADDITIVE': '2-Methylimidazole'}"
Wiley_OER_00873_13.txt,"All reagents were used without additional treatment. Ni foams were cut into rectangular pieces of 2 cm×4 cm. The Ni foam pieces were then put into 20 mL acetone to be sonicated for 20 min, and washed by deionized water for three times. The Ni foam pieces were further put into 20 mL 2 M hydrochloric acid to be sonicated for 10 min and washed by deionized water and ethanol for three times in sequence to remove nickel oxides and grease, and then dried in a 60 °C vacuum oven for 12 h. About 60 mg thioacetamide (TAA), 45 mg anhydrous sodium molybdate and 110 mg non-ionic surfactants (P123/F127/L31) were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water. The as-prepared rectangular Ni foam was then put into the above mixed solution and stirred magnetically at room temperature for 30 min. The prepared solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 200 °C for 24 h, where the Ni3S2/MoS2 was in-situ grown on Ni foams. The integrated foam was then washed by 20 mL deionized water and 20 mL ethanol for three times, and then dried in a 60 °C vacuum oven for 12 h.","{'SUBSTRATE': 'Ni foam'}, {'ADDITIVE': 'thioacetamide'}, {'ADDITIVE': 'non-ionic surfactants'}, {'SOLVENT': 'deionized water'}, {'TARGET': 'Ni3S2/MoS2'}, {'PRECURSOR': 'anhydrous sodium molybdate'}"
