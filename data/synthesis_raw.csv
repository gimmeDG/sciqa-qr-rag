ACS_OER_00157_6.txt,"The FeCoNiPxSy catalysts were prepared by electrodeposition on a planar Ti foil at −1 A cm–2 without stirring. For the deposition of FeCoNiPxSy, NiSO4, FeSO4, and CoSO4 were used as the metal salts and NaH2PO2 and H2NCSNH2 were used as the salts for introducing P and S dopants. Moreover, H3BO3 and NH4Cl were added to the deposition solution as additional agents to improve the quality of the deposits. The electrolyte bath contained 0.09 M NiSO4, 0.03 M FeSO4, 0.053 M CoSO4, 0.4 M H3BO3, 0.28 M NH4Cl, and certain amounts of NaH2PO2 and H2NCSNH2. The Fe:Co:Ni metal ratio was maintained at 17:31:52 because this ratio has been reported to afford catalysts with the best electrochemical performance.  When the P and S compositions of FeCoNiPxSy catalysts were tuned, the total amounts of NaH2PO2 and H2NCSNH2 were maintained at 1 M while those of NaH2PO2 (x M) and H2NCSNH2 (y M) were systematically varied and the resulting samples are denoted FeCoNiPxSy. These samples were FeCoNiP1S0, FeCoNiP0.8S0.2, FeCoNiP0.5S0.5, FeCoNiP0.2S0.8, and FeCoNiP0S1, which were prepared with a two-electrode electrodeposition.",electrodeposition
RSC_OER_01426_6.txt," A series of perovskite oxides LaCo1−xPtxO3−δ with x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 was synthesized via the CA–EDTA complexing sol–gel method. Stoichiometric La(NO3)3·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NO3)2 were dissolved in deionized water to form a clarified purple solution, with CA and EDTA added to the above solution in the molar ratio of total metal ions : CA : EDTA = 1 : 2 : 1. Then 25% ammonia hydroxide was dropped into the stirring solution until pH = 6.0–7.0. The mixture was magnetically stirred in water at 80 °C to form a transparent purple wet gel, followed by drying at 120 °C for 24 h. The obtained xerogel was calcined at 400 °C for 3 h to remove organic impurities and then at 850 °C for 5 h to form the final perovskite structure. ",sol-gel
Wiley_OER_00874_20.txt,"Synthesis of IrO2/birnessite catalysts. In a typical procedure, Mn(NO3)2 (113 mmol L−1), Co(NO3)2 (170 mmol L−1) and H2IrCl6 (56.7 mmol L−1), with required volume, were dissolved in 15 mL of 1 M NaOH. After homogenization and shaking, the mixture was aged for 10 min. No assistant agent including surfactant or H2O2 was added, making the synthesis a greener and safer approach. After being tightly sealed, the autoclave was kept in an oven. The solution was slowly heated to 220 °C and was maintained at that temperature for 12 h to obtain fine crystals. The solution was then naturally cooled at ambient temperature. The brown-black precipitate was collected and transferred to a suction filter. After washing the solid several times with deionized water, the residual ions and unwanted species were almost completely removed from hydrothermally prepared crystals. The retentate on the filter was stowed in a 50 mL beaker and dried in an oven at 60 °C for dehydration. Then, the final sample was collected in a ceramic crucible and annealed at 400 °C for 6 h to achieve fine crystallinity of the as-synthesized composites. In the preparation of birnessite MnO2 (or Mn−Co(8 : 2)-Bir), a mixture of 0.5 mL of 30 % H2O2 and 15 mL of 1 M NaOH in the Mn(NO3)2 (or Mn(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2 with required volume) precursor solution, and a dark brown suspension was immediately observed. The suspension was transferred to the autoclaves, which was later followed by the same procedure as IrO2/birnessite catalysts.",hydro-solvothermal
