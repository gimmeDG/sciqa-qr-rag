ACS_OER_00325_12.txt,"In situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements were performed on a differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) system (supported by Shanghai Linglu Instruments Co., Ltd.). The self-standing electrocatalyst directly served as the working electrode. KOH (1.0 M) with 15N and 14N labeled CO(15NH2)2/CO(14NH2)2 were used as the electrolyte. The gas products were pumped into the mass spectrometer through an argon carrier, and the signal of mass to charge was collected.",system
RSC_OER_00007_9.txt," The OER performances of NiFe0.1O and commercial RuO2 are investigated using a standard three-electrode system with 1.0 M KOH as the electrolyte. Due to the influence of ohmic resistance, the measured reaction currents did not directly reflect the intrinsic properties of the catalysts. We performed iR corrections on all raw data for further analysis. As shown in Fig. 4a, the as-prepared NiFe0.1O shows the lowest overpotential of 274 mV at 10 mA cm−2, compared with NiO (331 mV) and commercial RuO2 (319 mV). This activity improvement is attributed to the optimized structure and grain boundary defects after the incorporation of Fe. To obtain more information about the kinetics of the OER, Tafel slopes were analyzed (Fig. 4b). The Tafel plot of NiFe0.1O shows a much smaller Tafel slope (79.1 mV dec−1) than those of NiO (127.9 mV dec−1) and commercial RuO2 (180.2 mV dec−1), indicating an accelerated reaction kinetics due to the accelerated mass and electron transfer capacity derived from Fe and more active sites exposed by grain boundary defects. It is well known that different Tafel slopes represent different rate determination steps within a given path. The highly charged Fe sites in Fe-doped NiO will increase the oxidation state and facilitate the formation of HO* and O* intermediates. The decreased Tafel slope of NiFe0.1O suggests a more favorable OER activity. Apart from activity, stability is another key parameter for evaluating the performance of OER electrocatalysts. The polarization curve of NiFe0.1O suggests a slight difference after 2000 CV cycles, proving its excellent stability (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, the chronopotentiometry of NiFe0.1O indicates its long-term stability at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The current density is fluctuant due to the O2 bubbles and has not changed substantially after 10 hours of testing (Fig. 4d). Then, by comparing the TEM images before and after the OER test (Fig. S5†), we found that the layered stacked structure of the sample remained basically unchanged, indicating that the sample was stable.

Wiley_OER_00270_18.txt,"The NiFe-CS was synthesized by a modified Pechini method and by thermal treatment in an oxidizing and a reducing atmosphere. The proper molar quantities of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) were dissolved into distilled water containing citric acid (99.5%, Kanto chemical Co., Inc.) as the chelating agent. The as-obtained mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 7 h to produce a gel, which was then heated in air at 400 °C for 1 h to produce the char containing nickel-iron oxide. The as-prepared char powders were uniaxially pressed into a pellet at 1370 MPa, followed by thermal treatment under oxidizing conditions (400 °C, 1 h, ◂...▸◂◽.▸PO2≈0.21 atm) and in a reducing atmosphere (450 °C, 3 h, ◂...▸◂◽.▸PO2≈◂◽˙▸10−33 atm).",synthesis
